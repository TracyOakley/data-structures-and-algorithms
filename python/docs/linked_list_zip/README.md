# Challenge Summary
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.

## Whiteboard Process
![Linked List Zip Whiteboard](./401CodeChallenge08.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Time => O(n) because must visit each node of each linked list so will increase linearly as list increase
Space=>  O(1) because the input link lists will be the same length as output list
