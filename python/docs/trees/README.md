# Trees
+ Implement a Binary and Binary Search Tree

### [Link to the Code](../../data_structures/binary_tree.py)

## Challenge
+ Create a Binary Tree Class
  + Define a method for each of the three depth first traversals: pre_order, in_order, and post_order
+ Create a Binary Search Tree Class
  + Define a methon for Add and Contains

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time for binary search is O(h) base on the height of the tree.

## API
We implemented with a Node class
BinaryTree
+ in_order
+ post_order
+ pre_order
BinarySearchTree
+ Add
+ Contains
